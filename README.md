# Item-Manager
Item Manager is a Spring Boot REST API project that manages items using in-memory ArrayList storage. It demonstrates CRUD operations, DTO validation, and a clean layered architecture with Controller, Service, and Repository. No database is used, making it lightweight and ideal for learning core backend concepts.
